Welcome to PAI (**P**ractical **AI**) Lab! Our lab works on making AI that is useful in real life, especially in understanding images and videos through computer vision.

Our research interests are diverse yet focused, encompassing weakly and semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, robust learning, active learning, and multi-modal learning. We are committed to creating AI technologies that adapt, learn, and thrive in the dynamic and often unpredictable landscape of real-world challenges.

If you are interested in what we do and want to join us, do not hesitate to [Email us](mailto:junhyug@ewha.ac.kr)!

🚀 We are currently hiring **G-LAMP postdoctoral researchers** to join our lab. Please refer to the [official announcement](http://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewha/news/notice.do?mode=view&articleNo=359171&article.offset=0&articleLimit=10&srSearchVal=g-lamp&no=2).
